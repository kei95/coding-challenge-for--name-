# coding-challenge-for-name
This is my attempt to finish a challenge made by my firend [@axross](https://github.com/axross) as much as I can in an hour. It's a pretty good exercise you can try in an hour to see how ready you are for "practical" interview, which is different from regular coding interview that is usually about solving algorythms. If you are interested, check [this page](https://gist.github.com/axross/6bd60da3cbe6381ddc249a58196a65c3) for the further detail.
